* Scripting in Python, Perl, or any language that supports named pipes.
* Nyquist Very powerful built-in scripting language that may also be used to create plug-ins.

## Contributing
Want to contribute? Feel free to! No knowledge of coding required, as we still have a couple of tasks to be done that _don't_ involve coding. For more info, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/generic-pers0n/saucedacity/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you do know how to code, C++ is required, as Saucedacity is written in C++. If you know Rust, however, we might accept contributions including Rust code (**not guaranteed**, see [#2](https://github.com/generic-pers0n/issues/2) in our issue tracker for details).

Regardless, you can find issues in our issue tracker, found [here](https://github.com/generic-pers0n/saucedacity/issues), that always need fixing.
